                                <p>Mike Lovely is the owner of Lovely Strength and Conditioning. He is a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist with the <a href="https://www.nsca.com/">National Strength and Conditioning Association.</a></p>
                                <p>Mike opened his gym after spending 10 years at the collegiate level. For five of those years he was the head strength coach at Corban University. During Mike's five years as head of Corban's strength and conditioning program, eleven of the teams improved from sub 500 level to well over 500 winning teams.</p>
                                <p>Mike finds the best way to get the most out of athletes is to begin by building rapport.  With only 12 athletes in a clss he has the opportunity to coach technique and build a connection with each person in the process.  The coaching environment Mike has developed is fun and engaging, while the work is hard, but rewarding.</p>

                                    <p>July 2 - August 24th <br> Sessions closed until Summer 2019.</p>
                                    <p>Elite athletes train in season and out of season. Athletes can be described as very strong, flexible, well conditioned, explosive, and durable to the stress of play.</p>  

                                    <p>In the Summer your athlete will be challenged to become stronger while maintaining or improving flexibility each day.  Mike Lovely will coach your athlete to perform the correct mechanical qualities of sprinting, how to stop, start, jump, land, and change direction using the most efficient movement patterns.</p>

                                    <p>Lovely Strength & Conditioning trains small groups of athletes to encourage healthy competition with corrective feedback of technique and performance. Athletes training with Mike Lovely can expect to jump higher, run faster, and improve their reaction time to external stimuli.</p>

                                    <p>Elite athletes work at improving their quality of movement.  Starting, stopping, changing directions in small degrees to 180 degrees, are all movements that have a particular quality of efficiency.  These movemements can be learned and practiced by any athlete to become faster and adapt to higher levels of competition.</p>
                                    <p>Acceleration, stopping and changing direction are the big three movements that bulid the foundation of speed development.  These three qualities will be taught during each session with a variety of drills.  As athletes mature in their movements more layers of challenge will be added to their sessions.  Plyometrics, fast twitch muscle development, will also be used during the sessions to add a greater "spring to an atheletes step." </p>
                                    <p>Each session has a specific focus.  Often times each athlete will be working on their personal specific with the larger picture of the "main focus."</p>
